I'm a first year PhD student in biostatistics at the Dalla Lana School of Public Health at the University of Toronto. My research interests include causal inference, Bayesian methods, image analysis and their applications in public health and medical research. This summer, I am working on building a Dirichlet process submodule for [PyMC3](https://docs.pymc.io/) as a Google Summer of Code student! During my free time, I enjoy skateboarding 🛹 and eating fruits 🍐. Feel free to connect with me!
